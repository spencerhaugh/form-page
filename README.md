# Submission Form

## Summary

This form was built with vanilla javascript in an effort to be lightweight, over a solution such as React.  
I have written validation logic to require fields denoted with an \*, as well as requiring at least one checkbox to be selected on submission. The form will display an error message at the fields requiring attention, as well as adding highlighting.  
Once valid, the submit button sends a POST request to the server with the information provided to the form, and returns a success message in the console.

## Get started

Run npm install, followed by npm start in your terminal to start the server and view this page locally on localhost:3000.  
The form will ruturn a success message in the console only if the form is valid and allowed to be submitted.
